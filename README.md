Sawdust is a lightweight, modular framework for Roblox developers who want clarity, control, and smart abstractions, without the bloat ðŸ˜‰

> ðŸ’– Built with love by **Griffin Dalby**<br>
> ðŸ›  Designed for efficient, easy-to-read, and easy-to-use code - made for devs who hate reading docs.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ’‰ **Service Injection System**  
  Build, inject, and manage services with dependency resolution.

- ðŸ”— **Smart Networking**
  Middleware, wrapped connections & event calls, all with a clean channel-based structure.

- ðŸ“¦ **CDN System**
  Efficient asset delivery with preload batching and efficient caching.

- ðŸ“£ **Signal Emitters**
  Embeddable event behavior for services or general-purpose modules.

- ðŸ“œ **Cache API**
  Stackable cache management built for structure, and speed.

- ðŸ§¹ **Maid Utility**
  Clean up anything, connections, callbacks, instances, all with tag-based logic.

- âœˆ **And much, much more planned**
  I hope to get as much quality of life features as possible.

- ðŸŒ³ **Lignin**
  Lignin is a plugin being developed to aid even further with sawdust development.
  You'll be able to gradually create networking channels and events/functions, and many more things
  All of these will create automatic type metadata for a dynamic feeling typechecking experience including assetIds and networking event names.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Sawdust is designed to:
- Give **maximum control** to the developer
- Encourage **clean runtime logic**
- Reduce **boilerplate**
- Promote **discoverabiliy** via tooling & naming clarity
- Minimize documentation checks

You get **injection + dependency** management without losing Luau's flexibility.

## ðŸšš Installation

1. Drop the Sawdust folder into `ReplicatedStorage`
2. Access it on server or client via:
```lua
local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)
```
3. Access the implementations like:
```lua
local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)

local services = sawdust.services
local networking = sawdust.networking
local cache = sawdust.cache
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Build a Service
```lua
--> In ServerScriptService.SawdustServices

local builder = sawdust.builder
local services = sawdust.services

services:register(builder.new('OtherService')
    :init(function(self, deps) --> 'init' runtime phase
        self.data = 'Hello!' --> Set OtherService.data to 'Hello!'
    end)
    :method('methodName', function(msg) --> Create a new method (OtherService.methodName(msg))
        print(`Method was called, message: "{msg}"`)
    end)
    :inject('init', function(self, deps) --> Inject function into 'init' runtime phase
        print('Injection into OtherService success!')
    end))

services:register(builder.new('ExampleService')
    :dependsOn('OtherService') --> Depend on the OtherService
    :init(function(self, deps) --> :init() phase
        self.otherService = deps.OtherService
    end)
    :start(function(self) --> :start() phase
        print(`Data from other service: "{self.otherService.data}"`)
        self.otherService.methodName('I called the function from ExampleService!')
    end))

services:resolveAll() --> :init() all services
services:startAll() --> :start() all services

--[[

    This should print this, in order:
    'Injection into OtherService success!'
    'Data from other service: "Hello!"'
    'Method was called, message: "I called the function from ExampleService!"'

--]]

```

### Networking Middleware
```lua
local networking = sawdust.core.networking
local channel = networking.getChannel('ExampleChannel') --> Sawdust\Events\ExampleChannel

channel.TestEvent:fire('Hello, world!') --> Sawdust\Events\ExampleChannel:FireClient() or :FireServer(), this is handled dynamically.
channel.TestEvent:connect(function(player: Player, message: string)
    print(`Player {player.Name} told us "{message}"`)
end) --> If you have a RemoteFunction, now you can connect multiple callbacks to it.
--> WARNING: You CAN do it on server, but remember, RemoteFunctions returning to the server period isn't a good idea.

channel.TestEvent.middleware:use('before', 1, function(pipeline)
    pipeline:setArguments(...) --> You can modify the arguments being passed before the event gets fired to destination.

    pipeline:setHalted(true|false) --> You can "halt" it, meaning the event wont be fired
    pipeline:setErrorMessage('Error Message') --> If you halt it, you should set the error message for debugging.
end)

channel.TestEvent.middleware:use('after', 1, function(pipeline)
    pipeline:setResult(...) --> Like before, you can modify the result of a RemoteFunction before its passed to where it needs to go.

    pipeline:setHalted(true|false) --> Same story, it just wont be passed.
    pipeline:setErrorMessage('Error Message') --> Exact same story.
end)
```

## ðŸ§ª Tests
I've built unit tests for sawdust and [all of the implementations]("This may not be ALL implementations at time of reading, I may still be working on some."), you can read more about this

## ðŸ“– Documentation
I do hate documentation, and this library is being built to be independent of documentation, however one is being built but not yet published. <br>
Until it's finished, check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed module additions and improvements.
