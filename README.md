# ðŸŒ² Sawdust Framework

Sawdust is a lightweight, modular framework for Roblox developers who want clarity, control, and smart abstractions, without the bloat ðŸ˜‰

> ðŸ’– Built with love by **Griffin Dalby**
> ðŸ›  Designed for efficient, easy to read and use code with a clean structure for those who hate to read docs

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ’‰ **Service Injection System**  
  Build, inject, and manage services with dependency resolution.

- ðŸ”— **Smart Networking**
  Middleware, wrapped connections & event calls, all with a clean channel-based structure.

- ðŸ“¦ **CDN System**
  Efficient asset delivery with preload batching and efficient caching.

- ðŸ“£ **Signal Emitters**
  Embeddable event-like behavior for use within Services or general-purpose OOP modules.

- ðŸ“œ **Cache API**
  Stackable cache management built for structure, and speed.

- ðŸ§¹ **Maid Utility**
  Clean up anything, connections, callbacks, instances, all with tag-based logic.

- ðŸŒ³ **Lignin**
  Lignin is a plugin being developed to aid even further with sawdust development.
  You'll be able to gradually create networking channels and events/functions, and many more things
  All of these will create automatic type metadata for a dynamic feeling typechecking experience including assetIds and networking event names.

- âœˆ **And much, much more planned**
  I hope to get as much quality of life features as possible.

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Sawdust is designed to:
- Give **maximum control** to the developer
- Encourage **clean runtime logic**
- Reduce **boilerplate**
- Promote **discoverabiliy** via tooling & naming clarity
- Minimize documentation checks

You get **injection + dependency** management without losing Luau's flexibility.

## ðŸšš Installation

1. Drop the Sawdust folder into `ReplicatedStorage`
2. Access it on server or client via:
```lua
local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)
```
3. Access the implementations like:
```lua
local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)

local services = sawdust.services
local networking = sawdust.networking
local cache = sawdust.cache
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Build a Service
```lua
--> In ServerScriptService.SawdustServices

local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)

local builder = sawdust.builder
local services = sawdust.services

services:register(builder.new('OtherService')
    :init(function(self, deps) --> 'init' runtime phase
        self.data = 'Hello!' --> Set OtherService.data to 'Hello!'
    end)
    :method('methodName', function(msg) --> Create a new method (OtherService.methodName(msg))
        print(`Method was called, message: "{msg}"`)
    end)
    :inject('init', function(self, deps) --> Inject function into 'init' runtime phase
        print('Injection into OtherService success!')
    end))

services:register(builder.new('ExampleService')
    :dependsOn('OtherService') --> Depend on the OtherService
    :init(function(self, deps) --> :init() phase
        self.otherService = deps.OtherService
    end)
    :start(function(self) --> :start() phase
        print(`Data from other service: "{self.otherService.data}"`)
        self.otherService.methodName('I called the function from ExampleService!')
    end))

services:resolveAll() --> :init() all services
services:startAll() --> :start() all services

--[[

    This should print this, in order:
    'Injection into OtherService success!'
    'Data from other service: "Hello!"'
    'Method was called, message: "I called the function from ExampleService!"'

--]]

```

### Networking Middleware
```lua
local sawdust = require(game:GetService('ReplicatedStorage').Sawdust)

local networking = sawdust.networking
local channel = networking.getChannel('ExampleChannel') --> Sawdust\Events\ExampleChannel

channel.TestEvent:fire() --> Sawdust\Events\ExampleChannel:FireClient() or :FireServer(), this is handled dynamically.
channel.TestEvent:connect(function(player: Player, message: string)
    print
end) --> If you have a RemoteFunction, now you can connect multiple callbacks to it.
--> WARNING: You CAN do it on server, but remember, RemoteFunctions returning to the server period isn't a good idea.

channel.TestEvent.middleware:use('before', 1, function(pipeline)
    pipeline:setArguments(...) --> You can modify the arguments being passed before the event gets fired to destination.

    pipeline:setHalted(true|false) --> You can "halt" it, meaning the event wont be fired
    pipeline:setErrorMessage('Error Message') --> If you halt it, you should set the error message for debugging.
end)

channel.TestEvent.middleware:use('after', 1, function(pipeline)
    pipeline:setResult(...) --> Like before, you can modify the result of a RemoteFunction before its passed to where it needs to go.

    pipeline:setHalted(true|false) --> Same story, it just wont be passed.
    pipeline:setErrorMessage('Error Message') --> Exact same story.
end)
```

## ðŸ“– Documentation
I do hate documentation, and this library is being built to not need it as much as possible. In spite of this, I'm making one and it'll be released publicly on pages soon. Until then, check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed module additions and improvements.
