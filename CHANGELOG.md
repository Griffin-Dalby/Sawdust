> ## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-02
> #### **THIS IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED!**
>
> ### Additions
>
>> #### **Unit Testing** `src\ServerScriptService\UnitTests`
>> - Full-fledged unit testing for most implementations.
>> - Support for both server/client tests, useful mainly for Networking.
>
>> #### **Promises** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\promise`
>> - Simply a promise system modeled after NodeJS.
>> - You can chain together andThen(), catch with catch(), and of course final()
>
>> #### **Animation** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\animation`
>> 
>
>> #### **Utilities** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\util\*`
>> - **"Debounce"** allows easy creation of debounces with specified times.
>> - **"EnumMap"** allows the developer to "map" out Enums, converting them into human-readable strings, and back.
>> - **"States"** provides a dynamic interface where you can give objects states, with smart handling.
>> - **"Timer"** can run functions in a wrapped heartbeat where you can start, stop, and resume the internal connection.
>> - **"UUID"** simply provides a more intuitive UUID generator with much more customization.
>
> ### Changes
>
> - `Sawdust.lua` Made exports more human readable 😢
> - `Sawdust.lua` Okay nvm I just redid the layout
>
> ### Fixes
>
> - `__impl\networking` Fixed SawdustEvent:connect() not returning the connection, and improper typechecking.
> - `__impl\builder` Fixed issues w/ init/injection & pipeline
> - `__internal\__service_manager` Fixed issues w/ runtime

> ## [1.0.2] - 2025-06-17
> Dependency-injected service implementation with support for runtime injections & dependencies.
>
> ### Additions
>
>> #### **SVCBuilder** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\builder`
>> - Wrapper to build a **SawdustService**
>> - "**Injection**" allows developers to "Inject" code into a phase of service runtime *(e.g. 'init' & 'start')*
>> - "**Dependency**" allows developers to "Depend" their service on another, allowing services to load only after others load.
>> - When a service depends on another, the services the first one depends on will be passed in *init*, and any code injected into *init*.
>
>> #### **SVCManager** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__internal\__service_manager`
>> - Must be called through **Sawdust** main module. `Sawdust.services`
>> - In a setup script, you need to use `services:register(SawdustService)`, getting **SawdustService** from **SVCBuilder**
>> - After, you do `services:resolveAll()` to **initalize** each service.
>> - To **start** the services, follow that with `services:startAll()`.
>
> ### Changes
> 
> `__impl\networking` Added a "once" flag for a connection, disconnecting connection as soon as a event is caught.
> `__impl\networking` Also added a "wait" method, yielding the script until an event is caught.
> `Sawdust.lua` Changed the way implementations get passed through Sawdust main module.
> `README.md` 



> ## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-17
> New content delivery implementation with support for preloading assets, and efficent memory & caching practices.
>
> #### Additions
>
>> ##### **CDN** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\cdn`
>> - Created a dynamic and quite efficient CDN system, utilizing the caching module internally.
>> - Allows you to get "**Providers**" whose main job is to provide assets utilizing AssetIDs.
>> - Provides a "**Preload**" feature, allowing you to preload assets in batches, or singulars
>> - I want to flex how efficent I made it actually, I love how it turned out so much 🙏
>
> #### Changes
> - `__impl\cache` Allowed finding caches within caches, basically allowing you to have objects much like tables.



> ## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-16
> Inital release of Sawdust library with a couple core implementations. 
>
> #### Additions
>
>> ##### **Networking** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\networking`
>> - "**Middleware**" allowing developers to attach events to different points of an event's lifecycle
>> - Very easy to understand interface, splitting events into "channels" that you can easily access and connect.
>> - Event behavior is wrapped smartly, functions and events work the same, but their special behavior is kept in-tact.
>
>> ##### **Signaling** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\signal`
>> - Provides the developer with "Emitters", that you can add events to for very simple, embedded event behavior.
>> - Smart memory handling and cleanup
>
>> ##### **Caching** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\cache`
>> - Splits data into "Caches", from there you can simply get and set data.
>
>> ##### **Maid** `src\ReplicatedStorage\Sawdust\__impl\util\maid`
>> - Apart of the "Util" implementation, the Maid module lets the devloper create a new Maid instance.
>> - Said maid instance can take track of instances, connections, and callback functions.
>> - The developer can "tag" these tracked objects with names, and take action based off of the tags alone.
>> - You can call `:clean(tag: string|nil)` to cleanup all tracked data, or only tagged data.
